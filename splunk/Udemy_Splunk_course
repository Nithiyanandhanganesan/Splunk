There are three types of Splunk deployment models:
  - Single instance
  - Distributed
  - Splunk in the Cloud

Stages:
  - Data Input
  - Parsing and indexing
  - searching

Deployment scenario:
  - Departmental Deployment
       - Single search head/Indexer
       - Up to 10 forwarder
       - appropriate for 10 customers

  - Small Enterprise Deployment
       - Single search head
       - 2 to 3 Indexer
       - 100 to 200 forwarder

  -  Large Enterprise Deployment
       - Search head clusters
       - Indexer clusters
       - Thousand of forwarders
       - Data gets replicated in the indexer clusters. [Index replication]
       - Continue to search in case of any failure. It has auto-failover.
  - Cloud Deployment
       - Self service
         - 20 gb data ingestion
         - No AD/SSO
         - 20 concurrent searches
      - Managed
        - custom configuration


How Splunk Stores Data:
   - Splunk transforms the incoming data into events and stores it in indexes.
   - Event is single row of Data
   - data will be in key=value format.
   - splunk adds details fields to all events which is timestamps, host, source and source types.
   - Splunk stores the indexed data in buckets:
      - Hot     - newly indexed data
      - Warm    - no active writing
      - Cold
      - Frozen  - archival
      - Thawed  - restore from archive

   - $SPLUNK/var/lib/splunk/defaultdb/db/*    [Hot,Warm]
   - $SPLUNK/var/lib/splunk/defaultdb/colddb/*   [Cold]
   - $SPLUNK/var/lib/splunk/defaultdb/thaweddb/*  [Thawed]
